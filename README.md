Media tagger and organizer backend and GUI frontend.
Hydron aims to be a much faster alternative to the
[Hydrus Network](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus) and is currently in
early development.

Platforms: Linux, OSX, Win32, Win64

## Running

1. `hydron` to start the server. See `hydron -h` for more options.
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:8010" in a web browser

### Runtime dependecies

* ffmpeg >= 3.2 libraries (libswscale, libavcodec, libavutil, libavformat)

NB: Ubuntu patches to ffmpeg on some Ubuntu versions break image processing.
If running on Ubuntu, please compile from unmodified ffmpeg sources using:

### DBMS settings

By default hydron uses SQLite3 but you might want to switch to a diffrent
DBMS like PostgreSQL for performance reasons. To do this copy the sample config
file `docs/db_conf.json` into either `~/.hydron/` or `%APPDATA%\hydron`,
depending on your OS, and configure appropriately.

`go get github.com/bakape/hydron`
